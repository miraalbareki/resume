# HTML/CSS Resume

This is a simple, manually coded HTML/CSS resume created to demonstrate my ability to build a web page from scratch. 

- The resume includes a **Download Resume button** that allows you to download a PDF version.  
- The content in the HTML is **placeholder text**, so it does not contain real personal or professional data.  
- The structure is **simple and easy to follow**, showing how a professional resume can be implemented in code.
